## AI Agent Specifications

### AI Technical Architecture

**Provider:** Anthropic Claude Haiku 3.5  
**API Endpoint:** https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages  
**Model:** claude-3-5-haiku-20241022  
**Max tokens:** 1024

**Request Flow:**
1. User types command in command bar
2. Client sends to /api/ai/canvas with command + canvas state
3. Server calls Claude with function schemas
4. Claude returns function calls
5. Client executes each function via Liveblocks mutations
6. Changes sync to all users automatically

---

### Function Schemas

#### createShape Function
```typescript
{
  name: "createShape",
  description: "Create one or more shapes on the canvas",
  input_schema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      shapeType: {
        type: "string",
        enum: ["rect", "circle", "text"],
        description: "Type of shape to create"
      },
      count: {
        type: "number",
        description: "Number of shapes (1-10)",
        minimum: 1,
        maximum: 10
      },
      fill: {
        type: "string",
        description: "Hex color code"
      },
      text: {
        type: "string",
        description: "Text content (if shapeType is 'text')"
      },
      position: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          x: { type: "number" },
          y: { type: "number" }
        },
        description: "Optional position, defaults to center"
      }
    },
    required: ["shapeType", "count", "fill"]
  }
}
```

**Example Commands:**
- "Create 3 blue rectangles"
- "Create 5 red circles"
- "Add a text that says 'Hello World'"
- "Create a green rectangle"

---

#### arrangeGrid Function
```typescript
{
  name: "arrangeGrid",
  description: "Arrange selected objects in a grid",
  input_schema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      objectIds: {
        type: "array",
        items: { type: "string" },
        description: "IDs of objects to arrange"
      },
      rows: {
        type: "number",
        description: "Number of rows",
        minimum: 1
      },
      cols: {
        type: "number",
        description: "Number of columns",
        minimum: 1
      },
      spacing: {
        type: "number",
        description: "Space between objects (px)",
        default: 50
      },
      startPosition: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          x: { type: "number" },
          y: { type: "number" }
        },
        description: "Top-left corner"
      }
    },
    required: ["objectIds", "rows", "cols"]
  }
}
```

**Example Commands:**
- "Arrange these in a 3Ã—3 grid"
- "Arrange these horizontally"
- "Arrange these vertically"
- "Space these evenly"

---

### Context Sent to AI

**Canvas State (condensed):**
```typescript
{
  objects: [
    { id, type, x, y, width, height, fill, text? },
    // ... up to 100 objects
  ],
  canvasSize: { width: 20000, height: 20000 },
  selectedIds: ["obj-1", "obj-2"], // optional
  viewport: { centerX, centerY, zoom }
}
```

**System Prompt:**
```
You are an AI assistant that manipulates a collaborative canvas.
Users give commands like "Create 3 blue rectangles" or "Arrange these in a grid".
You respond with function calls that execute their intent.

Available functions:
1. createShape - Create shapes (rect, circle, text)
2. arrangeGrid - Arrange objects in a grid

Rules:
- Max 10 objects per createShape call
- Use reasonable default positions (near viewport center)
- Colors must be valid hex codes
- Be smart about spacing and arrangement
```

### Error Handling Matrix

| Error Type | Detection | Response | User Feedback |
|------------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Unknown function | Validate name | Ignore call | Toast: "AI command not understood" |
| Invalid params | Validate args | Cap/default values | Execute with corrections |
| API failure | Catch network error | Log error | Toast: "AI unavailable, try again" |
| Timeout (>10s) | setTimeout | Abort request | Toast: "Request timed out" |
| Rate limit | HTTP 429 | Exponential backoff | Toast: "Too many requests, wait 10s" |
| Invalid command | Empty response | No action | Toast: "Please rephrase" |

---

### Cost & Performance

**Per Command Cost:**
- Input tokens: ~500 (canvas state + schemas)
- Output tokens: ~200 (function calls)
- Cost: ~$0.0004 per command
- Budget: $5 = 13,000+ commands

**Performance Targets:**
- Claude API response: < 1.5s
- Client-side execution: < 0.5s
- Total perceived latency: < 2s

**Optimization:**
- Limit canvas state to 100 objects (reduce tokens)
- Cache function schemas (don't send every time)
- Debounce command submission (prevent spam)
