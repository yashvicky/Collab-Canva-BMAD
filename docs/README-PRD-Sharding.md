# PRD Sharding Complete ‚úÖ

## Summary

Your PRD has been successfully sharded into **development-ready files** following the BMAD methodology.

---

## Files Created

Save these artifacts to your `docs/prd/` folder:

### Core Documents
1. **overview.md** - Executive summary, timeline, scope
2. **functional-requirements.md** - All 25 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-025)
3. **non-functional-requirements-and-ai-specs.md** - NFRs, AI specifications, success metrics

### Epic Files
4. **epic-01-canvas-infrastructure.md** - Stories 1.1-1.2 (Canvas setup, Pan/Zoom)
5. **epic-02-shape-tools.md** - Stories 2.1-2.3 (Rectangle, Circle, Text)
6. **epic-03-realtime-collaboration.md** - Stories 3.1-3.4 (Liveblocks, Sync, Cursors, Presence)
7. **epics-04-through-07.md** - Stories 4.1-7.2 (Manipulation, Auth, AI, Polish)

---

## How to Use These Files

### During Development (In IDE)

**Starting a Story:**
```bash
# Example: Starting Story 1.1 (Canvas Setup)
# 1. Open the epic file
code docs/prd/epic-01-canvas-infrastructure.md

# 2. Read the story
#    - Acceptance criteria
#    - Technical specifications
#    - Tasks checklist

# 3. Reference architecture
code docs/architecture.md

# 4. Start coding
# Follow the tasks one by one
```

**With BMAD Agents:**
```bash
# Scrum Master creates detailed story
@sm Create the next story from docs/prd/epic-01-canvas-infrastructure.md

# Developer implements
@dev Implement story at docs/stories/story-01-canvas-setup.md
```

## File Organization

```
docs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prd.md                          # Original full PRD (keep for reference)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture.md                 # System architecture (already exists)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prd/                            # Sharded PRD (NEW)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ overview.md                 # Executive summary
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ functional-requirements.md  # All FRs
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ non-functional-requirements-and-ai-specs.md

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Right Now)

1. **Save all artifacts** to `docs/prd/` folder
   - Copy each artifact content
   - Create files in your project
   - Commit to git

2. **Verify files exist:**
   ```bash
   ls docs/prd/
   # Should show all 7 files
   ```

3. **Commit your work:**
   ```bash
   git add docs/prd/
   git commit -m "SESSION 2 complete: PRD sharded into epic files"
   ```

---

### Next Session: SESSION 3 (Already Done!)

Good news: **Your architecture.md is already comprehensive!** 

However, for BMAD best practices, we should shard it into these files:

**Architecture Sharding Plan:**
```
docs/architecture/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ overview.md                 # System architecture diagram
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ component-structure.md      # React components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data-architecture.md        # Liveblocks storage, Firebase
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ adr-0001-liveblocks.md      # Real-time sync decision
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ adr-0002-konva.md           # Canvas rendering decision
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ adr-0003-ai-claude.md       # AI function calling decision
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ adr-0004-firebase-auth.md   # Authentication decision
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ coding-standards.md         # TypeScript, React patterns
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tech-stack.md               # Dependencies, versions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project-structure.md        # File organization
```

## Time Saved

**Original BMAD Estimate:** 2-3 hours for SESSION 2
**Actual Time:** ~20 minutes (PRD was already excellent)
**Time Saved:** 1.5-2.5 hours

**Your Progress:**
- ‚úÖ SESSION 0: BMAD Setup (Complete)
- ‚úÖ SESSION 1: Research & PRD (Complete)
- ‚úÖ SESSION 2: PRD Sharding (Complete)
- ‚úÖ SESSION 3: Architecture (Already done!)
- ‚è≥ SESSION 4: PO Validation (30-45 min remaining)
- ‚è≥ SESSION 5: Final Prep (15 min)
- ‚è≥ SESSIONS 6-15: Development (15-20 hours)

## Pro Tips

**When Reading Epic Files:**
- Start with "Overview" to understand the goal
- Read "Acceptance Criteria" to know success
- Reference "Technical Specifications" for code patterns
- Follow "Tasks" as a checklist
- Use "Estimated Time" for planning

**When Stuck:**
- Check "Reference" section for code patterns
- Look at "Common Issues" for known problems
- Reference `docs/architecture.md` for system design
- Copy patterns from figma-clone repo

**Performance:**
- Always test with 2 browsers side-by-side
- Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab
- Verify 60 FPS is maintained
- Measure sync latency with Network tab

## Questions?

If you need clarification on any epic or story:
1. Ask me to explain the technical approach
2. Request code examples from figma-clone
3. Discuss alternative implementation strategies

**Next decision point:** 
- Option A: Continue to SESSION 4 (PO Validation)
- Option B: Start development immediately
- Option C: Shard architecture document first
