# Scope Validation - Collaborative Canvas Tools

## TAM Analysis

The market for collaborative canvas and whiteboard software is a significant and rapidly expanding segment of the broader collaboration tool market. The strong growth validates the market need for innovative solutions in this space.

| Metric | Collaborative Whiteboard Software | Design Collaboration Software |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Market Size (2024/2025)** | ~$3.17 Billion (2025) [1] | ~$3.8 Billion (2025) [2] |
| **Growth Rate (CAGR)** | ~18.5% to 20.85% (Forecast period) [1, 3] | ~14.8% (2025-2035) [2] |
| **Key Players** | Miro, Figma (FigJam), Microsoft, Google, Mural | Figma, Miro, Adobe, InVision |
| **Market Maturity** | Growing | Growing |

The market is characterized by high double-digit growth, indicating a **Growing** market maturity. This suggests that while established players dominate, the market is still receptive to specialized, innovative tools, especially those that leverage AI for a unique competitive advantage [4].

## Feature Priority (Based on Research)

Successful Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) and user feedback emphasize the foundational quality of the collaboration experience over a wide array of features.

### Critical (Must-Have for MVP)

1.  **High-Quality Real-time Sync & Low Latency** - **Why:** This is the core value proposition of a collaborative tool. Synchronization issues and lag are common pitfalls and lead to poor user experience, which is fatal for a collaborative MVP [5].
2.  **Real-time Cursor and Presence Tracking** - **Why:** Essential for a shared, singular, and open design space. It provides the necessary context and awareness for collaborators to work simultaneously without conflict [6].
3.  **Infinite Canvas & Basic Drawing Primitives** - **Why:** Provides the foundational workspace for brainstorming and design. An infinite canvas is a highly valued feature in user feedback for flexibility and scope [7].

### Important (Should-Have)

1.  **Basic Shape and Text Tools** - **Why:** Allows for structured ideation and diagramming, which are primary use cases for these tools (e.g., flowcharts, wireframes).
2.  **No Sign-up/Instant Access for Collaboration** - **Why:** Reduces friction for initial collaboration and is a key feature of successful, lightweight tools like tldraw and Excalidraw, which are often used for quick, ad-hoc sessions.

### Nice-to-Have (Post-MVP)

1.  **Advanced Export Options (e.g., PDF, PNG, Code)** - **Why:** Necessary for integrating the canvas into a broader workflow, but not critical for the core MVP experience of real-time collaboration.
2.  **Template Library** - **Why:** Speeds up common tasks (e.g., retrospectives, user journey maps) but is a feature that can be built out after the core technology is validated.

## Scope Recommendation

### For Challenge Success

Hackathon judges and evaluators prioritize projects that demonstrate a clear, functional solution to a problem.

Based on research, evaluators prioritize:

1.  **Functional MVP:** The core feature (real-time collaboration and AI manipulation) must work seamlessly and reliably.
2.  **Technical Execution & Innovation:** The project's unique AI-powered natural language manipulation feature aligns with the "Innovation" criteria and, if executed well, demonstrates strong "Technical execution" [8].
3.  **Problem-Solving and Relevance:** The tool must clearly solve a relevant problem (e.g., making canvas manipulation faster and more accessible via language).

### Our Current Scope vs. Research

The project's implied scope is a collaborative canvas tool with real-time sync and AI-powered natural language manipulation of canvas elements.

-   **Over-scoped:** The focus on **AI-powered natural language manipulation** is a highly innovative and technically complex feature. While it aligns with the "Innovation" criteria, it could be considered over-scoped for a typical MVP if it detracts from the **Critical** features (sync quality, latency).
-   **Under-scoped:** The current scope may be **under-scoped** in terms of **basic content tools** (e.g., sticky notes, basic shapes) if the focus is too heavily on the AI. These basic tools are essential for the canvas to be functional before the AI is invoked.
-   **Aligned:** The project is **aligned** with the market opportunity, which is the gap in dedicated, accessible tools for natural language element manipulation. It also aligns with the **Critical** need for high-quality real-time collaboration.

### Revised Scope Recommendation

**The core recommendation is to prioritize the quality of the real-time collaboration engine above all else, even if it means simplifying the initial AI commands.**

1.  **Cut:** Limit the initial scope of the AI feature to a single, high-impact command (e.g., "Group all elements by color" or "Summarize all text in the selected area") to ensure the technical execution is flawless. Avoid a broad, complex set of commands that could be buggy.
2.  **Add:** Ensure the MVP includes a robust set of **Critical** and **Important** features: high-quality real-time sync, cursor tracking, infinite canvas, and basic drawing/text tools.
3.  **Focus:** The winning feature will be the seamless integration of the AI command into a perfectly functioning, low-latency collaborative environment.
