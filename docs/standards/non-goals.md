# Non-Goals

The following items are intentionally deferred from the BMAD collaboration canvas MVP so the team can focus on realtime co-editing fundamentals.

- **Rich authentication flows**: no email/password or OAuth linking until after realtime presence stabilizes.
- **Advanced shape libraries**: stick to simple rectangles, circles, and text; smart connectors or flowchart widgets are out of scope.
- **Offline-first editing**: collaboration requires a network connection; offline queueing/sync is not supported in the MVP.
- **Mobile optimized UI**: layout targets desktop/tablet breakpoints first; responsive polish can follow once core features land.
- **Video or audio chat**: focus remains on shared visual canvas; integrate meeting tools later if user demand is clear.
- **Export to production formats**: PDF/SVG export is not a launch requirement; screenshots or recordings suffice for early testing.
- **Enterprise governance**: SSO, audit logging, and roles/permission hierarchies belong to later phases after product-market validation.
